    content: |    
      [Epicenter.works](https://epicenter.works/en/), the [Society for Civil Rights](https://freiheitsrechte.org/), the [Federation of German Consumer Organizations](https://www.vzbv.de/), and Stanford Professor [Barbara van Schewick](https://law.stanford.edu/barbara-van-schewick/) are filing an official complaint with the Federal Network Agency against Deutsche Telekom's unfair business practices.
            
      Deutsche Telekom is creating artificial bottlenecks at access points to its network. Financially strong services that pay Telekom get through quickly and work perfectly. Services that cannot afford this are slowed down and often load slowly or not at all.
      
      This means Telekom decides which services we can use without issues, violating net neutrality. We are filing a complaint with the Federal Network Agency to stop this unfair practice together!
